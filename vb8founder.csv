Adam Lancaster,Talent,https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamlancaster1/,"I have an Operations background and have helped build early phase ventures in e-commerce, Fintech and Health. 

I have wanted to start a company for a long time and Zinc's model was the most appealing way to do this. I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to meet founders who I would otherwise be unlikely to cross paths with, whilst benefiting from the guidance that Zinc provides.

Since my most recent role in a series B impact venture I have been keen to continue working on products that drive positive social change. I value market based solutions that achieve such goals. In other people I value teamwork, good listening, strong execution and accountability.

My strengths include hiring and training teams, translating business problems to software developers, managing budgets and designing Sales processes. I have extensive experience in people management, strategy, reporting and implementing third party software tools.","I'm seeking a co-founder with technical expertise who has founder-market fit. Ideally this would be someone with a bold vision who needs a partner to build and scale it with. I’m also open to working with people who have not yet defined their idea for a product. For us to work well together, my co-founder would need to possess genuine customer centricity, an openness to iteration, and a bias for data-driven decision making. Sense of humour and tenacity is also important; I value gritty people who are comfortable in the chaos of early phase ventures.","I’ve worked in 7 countries, including product launches in 3 markets.",Commercial,Single and looking for cofounders,,Both health of people and planet,

It all started with my B.Sc. degree from Istanbul Technical University (ITU), laying the groundwork for an exciting academic journey in molecular biology and genetics that saw me pursuing both M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at Osaka University, by a research fellowship from the Japanese Government. 

My scientific quest led me to the University of Cambridge, where I served as a research fellow under a Marie-Curie Fellowship and Human Frontiers Research Fellowship, and my discoveries were recognised by the Cambridge Independent Science and Technology Awards in the Researcher of the Year category.

I recently became a part of Zinc VC's Health of People program, a move that aligns perfectly with my passion to start my company. This program comes highly recommended within my network, boasting strong credentials and a solid reputation.","Integrity:
Integrity is the bedrock of any successful partnership. A co-founder with integrity operates with honesty, transparency, and ethical principles in all aspects of their work. They adhere to high moral standards, ensuring that decisions and actions are guided by integrity even in the face of challenges or temptations. This individual can be trusted to do the right thing, fostering trust and credibility within the team and with external stakeholders. Their commitment to integrity creates a culture of accountability and mutual respect, essential for long-term success.

Dedication:
Dedication is the unwavering commitment to the vision, mission, and goals of the venture. A dedicated co-founder is fully invested in the success of the venture, willing to go above and beyond to overcome obstacles and achieve objectives. They exhibit perseverance, resilience, and a strong work ethic, willingly putting in the time, effort, and resources necessary to drive progress. This individual inspires and motivates others through their passion and determination, rallying the team during both triumphs and setbacks. Their dedication fosters a culture of excellence and continuous improvement, propelling the venture towards its full potential.

Creativity and Assertiveness:
Creativity and assertiveness are two complementary qualities that drive innovation and effective decision-making. A co-founder with creativity brings fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and out-of-the-box thinking to the table. They possess the ability to think creatively, solve problems innovatively, and identify opportunities for growth and differentiation. This individual is not afraid to challenge the status quo, pushing boundaries and exploring new possibilities to drive the venture forward. Coupled with assertiveness, they confidently express their ideas, opinions, and convictions, advocating for what they believe is best for the venture. Their blend of creativity and assertiveness fosters a culture of innovation, agility, and strategic risk-taking, essential for staying ahead in a competitive landscape.","I am fluent in 5 languages: Turkish, Arabic, Japanese, Spanish, English.

Many existing systems offer only isolated functionalities for managing care, finances, compliance, or medication, without an integrated approach. This fragmentation leads to significant gaps in care, particularly in areas like proactive monitoring, medication management, social isolation, and overall wellbeing checks. Elderly individuals often feel unsupported and disconnected, which can exacerbate health issues and reduce their quality of life. Furthermore, these systems do not effectively integrate with GP surgeries, hospitals, or other healthcare providers, limiting the continuity and quality of care.

Solution: Our proposed solution is a scalable and flexible platform with a modular yet integrated architecture. This platform will enable virtual monitoring of elderly patients at home, helping them stay in their homes longer. 

Key features include:
Essential Modules: Comprehensive care management, financial operations, compliance tracking, and medication management.

Integration: Seamless integration with external healthcare providers like GP surgeries, hospitals, and specialty health services to enhance continuity of care.

Open API Framework: Easy incorporation of innovations and solutions developed by technology partners, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.

Proactive Patient Care: Advanced analytics to provide predictive insights into health, identifying potential issues before they become acute.

User Empowerment: Secure access to personal health data through user-friendly interfaces for elderly individuals and their families, enhancing autonomy and satisfaction.
Accreditation for Social Care: Ensuring the platform meets all regulatory standards for social care, providing peace of mind for users.

Traction
We have already built the care management platform and implemented it in 11 homes for Adults with Special Needs. To further advance the product, we need to invest in adapting it to achieve our goals. The platform will be open to plug in innovations and will be accredited for social care, ensuring it meets all necessary regulatory standards.

Customers
The primary customers will be NHS trusts and Social Care departments, who will benefit from a comprehensive, integrated system that enhances elderly care and reduces the need for institutionalisation.

","Commercial,Product,Tech & Software",Single and looking for cofounders,,Health of planet,"There are two opportunity areas within climate tech that I’m very interested in exploring (with domain experts!) The first is a climate-focused fintech that accelerates capital to renewable energy providers. I’m concerned about the amount of investment going into carbon credit markets and would like to develop an alternative proposition for companies that want to offset their carbon emissions- a model whereby the renewable energy facilities benefit from capital upfront to grow their operations, rather than having to wait for carbon credit revenue after the fact.  The other area that I’ve been increasingly concerned about is the impact of AI on climate change. For instance, Microsoft wanted to be carbon negative by the end of the decade, then it started investing big into AI and its emissions rose 30% over the past three years. AI requires massive amounts of computing power, which necessitate the construction of more data centers (using steel, concrete etc). How can we get ahead of widespread AI adoption, ensuring it is a green transition - either by helping companies choose data centers that rely on renewable sources or even innovating the built infrastructure itself.

Single use nappies make up almost 30% of all non biodegradable waste then release methane iand transfer raw faecal matter to the ground water, there is also significant environmental impact from the production process as nappies are 61% plastic. A number of local authorities have already introduced voucher schemes to incentivise uptake as disposal costs the taxpayer upwards of £100million annually and they have targets to cut waste by 50% by 2042 . 

The demand for more environmentally friendly options is expected to rise sharply as Gen Z become parents, in a 2021 survey of 3900 parents 88% of parents stated they think eco-conscious parenting is important for their children. When asked about what has stopped them from using a reusable nappy option, the top reason disposable nappy users gave was the washing (77%) so taking away the added labour of laundering and working with parents, nurseries and local authorities we can overcome this barrier. 

Additional to the environmental impact;  in 2019 the French Health and Safety agency ANSES tested best-selling brands of disposable nappies and found 38 “very severely hazardous” chemicals in those sold throughout Europe so there are also health concerns.

","Science,Domain",Single and looking for cofounders,,Health of planet,"The main opportunity and vision is marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR), which aligns with expertise in chemistry. In this case, scalability of climate intervention, exploits the 40X higher mass of dissolve inorganic carbon (DIC) in the oceans (38000 GtC) than carbon in the atmosphere (890 GtC), and at 140X higher concentrations. Removal of “carbonate” from the oceans, either via mineralisation or degassing, offers potential for rapid and widefield CDR, through natural drawdown of CO2 from the atmosphere by the oceans. Open processes such as enhance ocean alkalinity (EOA), via accelerated rock weathering, can shift the DIC equilibrium toward carbon storage as the bicarbonate ion (HCO3-). Alternatively, closed systems can push alkalinity toward carbonate ion (CO3(2-)) formation beyond saturation of carbonate salts, forcing precipitation and carbon mineralisation (magnesite and calcite) with a high permanency and lock in. In the opposite sense, increased acidity can used to evolve CO2 from seawater, captured and utilised. Alkalinity or acidity can be introduced in closed seawater processing, via electrochemical means or waste streams (concrete fines, steel slag, acid mine drainage). Other routes via temperature, evaporation and pressure induced precipitation of carbonates using solar may also be possible. Value can be added from end use of carbonates (building, pharma, soil stabilisers) and potential by-products (hydrogen, desal water, rare metal minerals, CO2 utilisation), depending on the method of CDR.

Despite overall NHS spending on mental health services reaching £12.8 billion in 22/23, the majority (75%) of young people with mental health problems aren’t being treated. 

In a YoungMinds commissioned survey, 76% of parents said their child's mental health had deteriorated while waiting for support from CAMHS, 67% of young people said they would prefer to be able to access mental health support without seeing their GP, but half (53%) said they didn't know how else to access this help. 
 
Parents / Care Givers are often best placed to support their child / children’s mental health needs but don’t feel equipped to, resulting in referrals to GPs (which don’t meet the threshold), frustrated parents and blockages in the system.  

Spring is a preventative digital platform, designed to increase the mental health literacy of parents via personalised bite-sized and accessible content, parenting programmes and access to mental health coaches to support the practical implementation of that knowledge.

Spring provides:
Personalised content and information – parents told us whilst there is awash of information out there on the net, it's overwhelming. So, by answering a few personalised questions we ensure the right content gets in front of the right people we’ve built a prototype of what this could look like to the user.
Access to Mental health coaches to provide support and advice to parents, helping them practically implement the information / knowledge they have absorbed – parents told us they don’t know how to put things into action and the fact their child is suffering poor mental health has a negative impact on their own mental health.
Access to therapeutic support as necessary – parents told us they would access private therapy but don’t know where to start, Spring via the Mental health coaches can help support parents on what therapeutic intervention may be effective along with access to therapists they can book sessions with if they choose to.

These disease are characterised by periods of stiffness and joint pain which can severely affect patients’ lives. Rheumatoid Arthritis alone affects 500K people in the UK and represents an economic burden of £3.8-4.8BN. There is strong evidence suggesting a link between physical and disease activity, where too little or too much physical activity - or a rapid transition between the two - can induce flares & disease progression (called 'push and crash' cycles). Yet only 20% of patients are regularly physically active. 

The solution seeks to augment current gold-standard disease-monitoring methodologies with the power of smart-wearable devices which provide continuous and unobtrusive monitoring, empowering patients to manage their condition through physical activity. Through a combination of physiological, accelerometer-based, and patient-reported data, disease activity can be accurately measured (this has been validated in recent papers). Prescribed active exercises allow users to improve stiffness and strength while delivering objective measurements. Furthermore, patients can be guided to tailor their daily aeorbic activity levels according to their individualised daily disease activity score to minimise symptoms (e.g. through tried-and-tested “activity pacing”). By tapping into real-time activity data, we can nudge patients to help them reach and stay within their individual 'energy envelope', offsetting the push and crash cycle they currently endure. Analysis of these measurements helps stratify patients with high disease activity for urgent medical attention and by harnessing the power of physical activity as a therapeutic, can enable true patient self-management.

Care of RA largely happens in the community: patients only see their Rheumatologist approximately once every 6 months, and 80% of patients go on to develop permanent joint damage. With the number of patients per Rheumatologist set to double by 2025, there is a need to better support patients in their homes. I believe these technological tools will transform the way we manage Rheumatic disease."
