As fractional CTO I support start-ups across their various stages of growth - both early stage and scaling. My focus is on data science, AI/ML and data-centric products in the B2B space. I have worked with start-ups across health tech, social/climate tech, and other industries, and on a wide range of issues, starting with technical/data science problems, all the way to leadership questions (e.g. how to set up your teams or processes).

I have worked in tech for more than a decade across data science and software development, in various functions all the way to CTO. After graduating from LSE I spent a decade in the banking, then later moved into the start-up space as Chief Data Scientist in a B2B AI start-up. I then moved on to lead their tech functions as COO/CTO, being responsible for the product and project management teams, as well as tech strategy, tech teams and tech operations.

My leadership journey has allowed me to look after very diverse teams, being responsible for 30+ headcount across tech and product. My core expertise is leadership, building performant tech teams, setting company and tech strategy, and nailing strategy execution. On the tech side, I am best placed to help with data science and AI/ML products.

I love the buzz of early stage start-up life.

Clare Brass,Chief Product Officer at Moree,https://www.linkedin.com/in/clare-brass-851771/,"In my ‘dirty past’ I was a product designer, but a profound passion for designing a better planet led me to a career helping others (students, start-ups, local/central government, and businesses) develop design-led circular economy strategies. I wanted to find out if it was possible for a designer to earn a living by creating businesses that addressed social or environmental challenges; and I realised that we needed to change the way design is taught, focusing on systems instead of physical stuff. 

I was head of sustainability at the Design Council before setting up social enterprise SEED Foundation, seeking entrepreneurial solutions to environmental challenges such as food, water and waste. In 2010 I established SustainRCA, an interdisciplinary centre fostering collaboration between designers at the Royal College of Art and business students at Imperial College, also acting as a mentor for the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. At SustainRCA I used design processes to drive student talent to explore and develop innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges of mainstream businesses, local councils, waste groups, etc.

In 2016 I co-founded Department 22, innovation agency for sustainability and circular economy with a focus on food. Together with her D22 team, I am currently developing Moree, a returnable/reusable packaging system that aims to make single use plastic a thing of the past.","Brainstorm & ideation,Constructive feedback / Sense check / Advice,Connect you with people in my network/industry,Strategy planning","""Biodiversity, regeneration and nature-based solutions""","Founder/Entrepreneur,Corporate,Consultancy","Product,Domain","Advise/consult ventures,Benefit from the Zinc Network,Collaborator / Partner to ventures,Have a Mission related impact,Be involved in early stage startups ,Connect ventures with people/customers,Grow network"

I have deep expertise in innovation processes and skills including problem definition/opportunity analysis, pitch creation, business model exploration, early-stage idea development, and growth strategy.

I began my career at British Gas with an internal transformation team focused on process and technology-enabled performance improvement projects. Having earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, I pursued a career in consultancy in the UK and subsequently the USA. This career phase includes various practice areas including environmental economics (at ECOTEC, now part of Ecorys), Business Process Re-engineering (at OASiS), and corporate venturing (at Mindshare and Strategos). 

I joined Xerox PARC in 2014 as the legendary Silicon Valley R&D lab’s first innovation consultant. I was appointed Director of Innovation Services for PARC, and I led a team of creative technologists, UX researchers, and designers supporting public- and private-sector clients seeking the differentiating ingredient of novel technologies in their products. An example of these complex, multidisciplinary collaborations between scientists and human factors researchers is, for Proctor and Gamble, a “scientific selfie” consumer skin diagnostic product consisting of machine learning and computer vision, and launched as Olay Skin Advisor.

In 2017 I joined Comcast as Executive Director of a product innovation team, building the team as an internal startup, overseeing user needs research and early design and technical development activities. In 2020 I became COO of Moon, the corporate incubator of Mitsui & Co., where I was responsible for physical and digital studio operations, and as a Board member sat on the investment committee funding new ventures. Having become increasingly committed to a focus on innovation driving decarbonisation and environmental regeneration, I returned to the UK to study for a MSc in Sustainable Development at the University of Surrey.

The main focus of my work is guiding our pre-existing built and natural environment towards a more regenerative, contextual and enjoyable future; I have a specialism in sustainable architecture, natural healthy materials and large scale strategies.

Michael Solomon,"Director, Responsible 100",https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-j-solomon/,"I help businesses to be optimally responsible. I.e. to perform as well as possible in respect of the various social, environmental and ethical issues they face, and for that to drive their commercial success.  

We’ve created what we believe is the most useful, logical and worthwhile test of business responsibility. It is a series of supported steps. We help businesses to better understand the dozens of responsibility issues they face; then work out how important each is to them (i.e. to their org size, sector and circs etc); then work out how well they currently respond to / perform on those issues; then work out a plan for improving on all the pressing and relevant things. We support businesses in doing all this as openly as possible. 

I’m an entrepreneur with 22 years of experience in responsible business and sustainability. IMO we’re wasting enormous amounts of time and effort doing the wrong things, deepening the polycrisis not solving it. Firms must accept the economic system they operate within is failing, and that performative CSR, ESG and Purpose etc are manifestations of that failure. 

We propose a Race To The Top, where firms compete on price, quality *and* on their ability to increase their positive impacts on people and planet - while decreasing their negative impacts - as fast, far and wide as possible. The Race To The Top is what the new Responsible 100 is designed to catalyse.

I am really interested in using the market and the tools of business to create the transformations the world needs. And in businesses that seek to compete in the Race To The Top.","Brainstorm & ideation,Connect you with people in my network/industry,Strategy planning,Constructive feedback / Sense check / Advice,Advice/consult ventures",None,,,"Collaborator / Partner to ventures,Invest in early stage ventures,Have a Mission related impact"
